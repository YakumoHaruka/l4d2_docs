	// Use a short name, since it is used as a tag on the servers for matching
	// your campaign when looking for a dedicated server.  Generally it should
	// be something unique.  One suggestion to is use your initials and a short
	// abbreviated name for your campaign. Avoid spaces and special characters.
	// Do not change the name when you create a revision, as the matchmaking
        // system will consider it a different campaign. Instead, use "Version" and 
        // "DisplayTitle" below to indicate revisions.

	// The version number is used when finding campaigns on dedicated servers
	// and in matchmaking. If you try to connect to someone in matchmaking
	// who has a newer version, you will be directed to download the new
	// version.  You must increment this to the next integer (whole numbers)every
        // time you release an update. (I.E. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
